# EV3-Robot-Plotter
This project demonstrates a means of using a robot to record, calculate, and display the average velocity of an object in motion.    In this project, a Lego EV3 robot was modified and programmed to record and then graph the average velocities of a moving object. The main robot was designed to use its ultrasonic sensor and internal timer to record the time it took for a secondary Lego EV3 robot to move over a series of four intervals of equal distances at a different constant speed across each interval. The main robot then used these recorded displacements and times to calculate the average velocity of the secondary robot over each of the four intervals.  From there, the robot, which was modified with a pen holder controlled by a third motor, moved to a piece of paper and graphed the average velocities on a velocity vs. time graph.
